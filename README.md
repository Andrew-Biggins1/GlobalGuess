# GlobalGuess

A request forum application where users post a photo of a location and request others to try and solve the whereabouts that photo was taken from. Users will have the ability to create an acount, submit photos and guess the location of other peoples photos. Accounts will save their 'score' (number of photos guessed), total guesses made, and success rate of your guesses.
